/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model.  Each user can only access their own data. Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
 * @data_structure All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring data isolation. User profiles are stored directly under the /users/{userId} path, and job applications are stored as subcollections under each user's profile.
 * @key_security_decisions User listing is disallowed.  All write operations are validated against the authenticated user's ID to prevent unauthorized data modification.
